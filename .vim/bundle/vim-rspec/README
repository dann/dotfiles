*** ATTENTION PLEASE ***

I stopped maintaining this plugin long time ago. I just made it to prove
we could do the same thing with Vim and Rspec as Textmate. 
Now Yan Pritzker is maintaining the plugin with his fork (now the official
vim-rspec plugin):

Thanks Yan!

Please don't use the code here. I'll keep it just for reference.
